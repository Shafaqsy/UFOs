## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to customize a webpage using bootstrap. Build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Also create filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing.
## Results:
This how the webpaage looks like when it is open. Ther's a title, backgroung image, paragraph, filter search and a table.

The filter search is super easy to use. There is a text given as a hint inside of each filter. It will help user to follow the format while searching.
