## Purpose:
The purpose of this project is to create a webpage build a table using data stored in a JavaScript array. Also create filters to make this table fully dynamic, meaning that it will react to user input, and then place the table into an HTML file for easy viewing. Add table filters for the date, city, state, country, and shape.
